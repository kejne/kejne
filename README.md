Hi!

I'm Kaj and I'm a freelancing software engineer who help organizations with building effective teams and to build state-of-the-art services in the cloud!
There are many developers out there who are better on coding than me. I work in teams where we complement each other and I'm the one that can build it all toghether!

I would love to get more involved in a side-hustle or open source project, so reach out if you have some ideas!
